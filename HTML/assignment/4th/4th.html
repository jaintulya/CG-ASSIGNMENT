    <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <hr><h2>Early Computers</h2>
    
    <p>The abacus was the first simple calculator. <em>Charles Babbage </em>designed the <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>, and Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm. Early machines were mechanical and slow. Later, electromechanical devices used electricity. The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> became the brain of the computer. The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was still far in the future.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Generation of computer </h2>
    <p>First generation: vacuum tubes, large and hot.
Second generation: transistors, faster and smaller.
Third generation: integrated circuits, powerful chips.
Fourth generation: microprocessors, personal computers.
Fifth generation: AI, robotics, and quantum computing.
Old punch cards were deleted, new cloud systems inserted. Formula: E = mc<sup>2</sup>. Water is H<sub>2</sub>O. <mark>Example: x<sup>2</sup> + y<sub>2</sub> = z<sup>2</sup>.</mark></p>
<hr>
<h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>

<p>The Internet started with ARPANET, a U.S. research project. It connected universities and allowed online communication. <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> made websites possible. <q>The Internet was not built in a day</q> Bill Gates said:
<blockquote>The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.</blockquote></p>
<hr>
<h2>Modern era</h2>

<p>The WWW grew in the <b>1990s.</b>Companies like <i><u>Google, Microsoft, and Apple changed the world.</u></i> Smartphones, social media, and AI now define the digital revolution. <ins>Cybersecurity</ins> is strong, ethics are important. IoT connects smart homes and cities. The Internet is now everywhere.</p>
